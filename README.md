## Overview

## Getting Started
### Deploying the Lambda

The lambda needs to be deployed into the same account as your invoking cloudformation stack. It can be deployed through the console from [here](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=eu-west-1#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:673103718481:applications/Cfn-Stack-Cleanup)
or it can be deployed from Cloudformation.

In order to deploy from CloudFormation, use the following as an example for your template.

```YAML

Description: Deploys CodePipeline Waiter Lambda function from Serverless Application Repo
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31


Resources:
  CodePipelineWaiter:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Application
    Properties:
      Location:
        ApplicationId: arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:673103718481:applications/Cfn-Stack-Cleanup
      SemanticVersion: 1.0.0
      # Optional Parameter to control the export name of the nested stack
      Parameters:
        ExportPrefix: !Ref AWS::StackName

```
#### Manual Deployment - Not Recommended
If you choose not to use the lambda from the Servlerless Repo, you can also manually build and deploy the lambda into your own account.
The following methods are not recommended due to the additional complexity this adds, use at your own discression.

```bash
# Build the Lambda
yarn build
```
Once built locally you can use one of several of the following methods.
* [SAM Deploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-deploy.html)
* [SAM Package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-package.html) or [Cloudformation Package](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/package.html) along with manual deployment of the resulting packaged template.
* Build and deploy the lambda from an AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild that's watching this repository
* Zip the lambda and deploy it manually.

### Raising Issues
We welcome anyone to contribute to this project.
Before raising a PR, reach out to us by [raising an issue](https://github.com/xavier-thomas/aws-cfn-stack-cleanup/issues) or by emailing the author.
There is a helpful issue template that can be used as a guideline to report issues or suggest new features.

### Raising PRs

Once you are satisfied with your work, you can raise a [Pull Request](https://github.com/xavier-thomas/aws-cfn-stack-cleanup/pulls).
The project's maintainers will need to approve this before it can be merged in and atleast 1 approving review is needed before your work can be merged in.

`Note`: Pre-Commit hooks are in place to perform audit, lint fix and run tests before you can commit. To ensure that unverified changes are not merged into master, when a new PR is raised on GitHub, the github actions workflow automatically runs the unit tests, mutation tests, [Sonar](https://sonarcloud.io/) and [cfn-lint](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint) to validate the PR. Without successful checks, your pull request will be blocked from being merged as a safeguard.
